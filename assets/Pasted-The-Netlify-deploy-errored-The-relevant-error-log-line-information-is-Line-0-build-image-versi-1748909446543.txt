Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
[line 70](#L70): The build failed with the error message "Could not resolve entry module 'client/index.html'."

### Solution
The error is likely occurring because the build script is unable to locate the entry module 'client/index.html'. To resolve this issue:

1. Ensure that the 'client/index.html' file exists in the correct location in your project's directory.
2. Verify that the file path to 'client/index.html' is accurate and matches the actual file location.
3. If 'client/index.html' is part of another source directory, update the path in the build script to point to the correct location.

After checking these points, run the build again to see if the issue is resolved.
