o	Declared Value
	This should be stated in US Dollars
o	Shipping Method
	This should be in the form of a dropdown list and should contain the following:
•	Air Freight
•	Sea Freight
•	Land Transporting values
•	
o	Shipping Costs
	Should be stated in US dollars
o	Cargo Insurance Cost
	Should be stated in US dollars
The calculator will calculate the following:
	Total Combined Tariff/Duty rate
o	This is equal to the summation of the following tariff duty rates
	Base Duty Rate
	Global Baseline Tariff
	Reciprocal Tariff (if applicable)
	Section 301 Tariff (if applicable)
	Total Landed Cost
o	This is equal to the summation of the following
	Total Declared Value
	Total Shipping Cost
	Cargo Insurance Cost

	The Total Tariff/Duty Cost
o	This is equal to the “Total Landed Cost” multiplied by the “Total Combined Tariff/Duty Rate”
	The Calculator is going to calculate the MPF fee
o	This is calculated by using the following method.
	a rate of .3464% multiplied by the Declared Value provided.
	With a default minimum fee calculation of $32.71
	A maximum fee calculation of $634.62
	The Calculator is going to calculate the  HMF fee
o	This is calculated by using the following method and Only applies if the user selects “Sea Freight” as a shipping method. If the user selects any other shipping method besides “Sea Freight” than the HMF fee defaults to $0.
	a rate of .125% multiplied by the Declared Value provided.

The following reference tables will be provided. 
	A table called the “HTS code table” will be provided where an HTS code will correspond to a description and the “base duty rate.”
	Another table will be provided that is related to a reciprocal tariff rates. The table is called “Reciprocal tariff table”  will have a country of origin that corresponds to the tariff rate listed in the table. If a user puts in a country of origin that is located on the reciprocal tariff table, the Reciprocal tariff rate will apply to the calculation. For example, if the user puts in the country of origin as “China” the reciprocal tariff rate will be 34%. 
	Another table will be provided related to Section 301 tariffs. This tariff rate only applies when the user lists the country of origin as “China” and provides a HTS code that is also listed in the “Section 301 tariff” table. For example. If a user lists HTS code 9603.90.80 and also states the country of origin as China, than the calculator will lookup this  HTS code on the “Section 301 tariff” table and see that that HTS code has a corresponding 7.5% tariff rate on the “Section 301 tariff table”. If the user lists “China” as the country of Origin, but the HTS code listed does not appear on the “Section 301 tariff” table, then the tariff rate will default to zero.
	Lastly the “Global Baseline Tariff”  of 10%, will apply to all calculations except if the user states “Canada” or “Mexico” as their country of origin.
